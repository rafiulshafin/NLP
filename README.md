Sentiment Analysis using BERT and ELECTRA
Project Overview
This project implements Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Text Data using two state-of-the-art transformer models: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and ELECTRA (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately).

The goal of the project is to fine-tune these pre-trained models on labeled sentiment datasets and evaluate their performance in text classification tasks.
